# Translations

The library comes with English and Italian translations, if you want to override them you can copy the files from the `src/Language` directory to your `app/Language` directory and then edit them.

If you wish to add a new language you can copy the `src/Language/en` directory to your `app/Language` directory, rename the `en` directory to your language code and then translate the files.
